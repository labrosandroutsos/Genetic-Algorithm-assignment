# Genetic-Algorithm-assignment
Second Part of the project for Computational Intelligence elective course 2020-2021 for CEID.
We create and use a Genetic Algorithm for feature selection for the MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Dataset.
The best neural model of the First Part (ANN-CNN assignment) is used for the GA.
We evaluate every individual depending on his prediction accuracy and the number of activated inputs (features) that he has.
At the end, we compare the best neural model of the First Part to the best neural model selected by the GA (with fewer inputs). 
The results were astonishing, only losing a miniscule percent of the prediction accuracy, while achieving a far lesser computational time and cost-complexity.
